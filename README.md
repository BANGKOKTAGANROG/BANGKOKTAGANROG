# Hello!
This is my GitHub repo to get started.

# Who am I?
### That's a good ass question
Technically I'm a Russian student of grade 10 public school, who is interested in working in IT somewhere in the future. More specifically, I see myself as a front-end developer in [**insert popular company**]. Will I ever get there? Who knows, if I actually start to learn shit, then maybe

# Desired tech stack
## again, I see myself as a front-end dev, so here:
- [] HTML
- CSS
- plain JavaScript/TypeScript
- at least 2 frameworks/libraries (React, Angular and so on)
