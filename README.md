# Hello!
This is my GitHub repo to get started.

# Who am I?
### That's a good ass question
Technically I'm a Russian student of grade 10 public school, who is interested in working in IT somewhere in the future. More specifically, I see myself as a front-end developer in [**insert popular company**]. Will I ever get there? Who knows, if I actually start to learn shit, then maybe

# Desired tech stack
### again, I see myself as a front-end dev, so here:
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] plain JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] at least 2 frameworks/libraries (React, Angular and so on)

## A bit about future
So uh I'm not really sure what to say here, just hope that I will learn stuff eventually and maybe even get my own portfolio. And _if_ shit goes ultra smooth, I may even end up working for some big ass company as a front-end dev!
