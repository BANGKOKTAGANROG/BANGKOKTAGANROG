well it depends actually. sometimes I see myself as a **full-stack Python developer**, sometimes as a **front-end dev** and sometimes as a **Unity/C++ game designer/developer**.

1. Front-end dev (React//Vue.js main)
1. Back-end developer (Node.js **OR** Django (or both?))
1. Full-stack Python dev
1. Unity/C++ game dev
