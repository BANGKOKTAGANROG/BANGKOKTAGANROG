well it depends actually. sometimes I see myself as a **full-stack Python developer**, sometimes as a **front-end dev** and sometimes as a **Unity/C++ game designer/developer**.
which one will i choose? nobody knows, but priority list is as follows:
1. Front-end dev (React//Vue.js mainer)
1. Full-stack Python dev
1. Unity/C++ game dev
